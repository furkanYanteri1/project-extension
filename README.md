### Project: Mocking Data VS Code Extension

#### Overview:
This project focuses on building a simple data mocking tool that works as both an npm package and a VS Code extension. The tool will allow developers to define, preview, and export mock data easily. A user-friendly UI in VS Code will enable schema customization, data generation, and real-time preview.

---

### Key Features:
1. **npm Package:**
   - Core logic for generating mock data.
   - Support for customizable schemas.
   - CLI and API for integration with other tools.

2. **VS Code Extension:**
   - **Schema Editor:**
     - Add, remove, or edit fields (e.g., name, age, etc.).
     - Select field types (string, number, boolean, etc.).
     - Add constraints (e.g., min/max, regex).
   - **Mock Data Preview:**
     - Real-time preview of generated mock data.
     - Pagination support for large datasets.
   - **Templates:**
     - Save and reuse schema templates.
     - Import/export templates across projects.
   - **Code Integration:**
     - Insert mock data directly into files.
     - Auto-generate TypeScript interfaces.

3. **Command Palette Integration:**
   - Shortcuts like `Mock: Create New Schema` or `Mock: Preview Data`.

4. **File Management:**
   - Save mock data as `.json` or `.ts` files.
   - Track and update schema changes.

### Implementation Plan:

#### Step 1: npm Package
1. **Core Functionality:**
   - Use libraries like `faker.js` or `chance.js` for mock data generation.
   - Provide APIs to define and validate schemas.
   - CLI commands for generating mock data from schemas.

2. **Testing:**
   - Write unit tests for schema parsing and data generation.
   - Ensure compatibility with multiple project types.

3. **Release:**
   - Publish the package on npm.

---

#### Step 2: VS Code Extension
1. **Scaffold the Extension:**
   - Use the `yo code` generator to create the project structure.
   - Set up the extension manifest (`package.json`) with commands and settings.

2. **Build the Schema Editor UI:**
   - Use VS Code Webview to create a drag-and-drop schema editor.
   - Include form elements for field configuration.

3. **Integrate with the npm Package:**
   - Call the package's APIs directly for data generation.
   - Handle schema storage and updates.

4. **Add Mock Data Preview:**
   - Render real-time mock data in the Webview.
   - Provide options for format and pagination.

5. **Testing:**
   - Test the extension on different operating systems.
   - Validate compatibility with various VS Code themes and settings.

6. **Publish:**
   - Publish the extension on the VS Code Marketplace.

### Challenges and Considerations:
1. **Performance:**
   - Ensure real-time previews are fast and responsive.
2. **UI Complexity:**
   - Keep the schema editor intuitive and flexible.
3. **Syncing Package and Extension:**
   - Maintain feature parity between the npm package and the VS Code extension.

### Next Steps:
1. Finalize the scope of the MVP (Minimum Viable Product).
2. Set up the project repository with basic scaffolding.
3. Start with the npm package development and core functionality.
4. Design and prototype the VS Code extension UI.
5. Iterate based on feedback and refine the features.
